One of the common undoes takes place when you
commit too early and possibly forget to add some
files, or you mess up your commit message.  If
you want to try that commit again, you can run:
git commit --amend. This command takes you staging
area and uses it for the commit. If you've made no
changes since your last commit (for instance, you
run this command immediately after your previous
commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the
same, and all you'll change is your commit message.
The same commit message editor fires up, but it
already contains the message of your previous commit.
You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.
