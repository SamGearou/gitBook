If you want to see more information about a particular remote, 
you can use the git remote show [remote-name] command. If you 
run this command with a particular shortname, such as origin, 
you get something like this: git remote show origin. If you 
want to rename a reference you can run git remote rename to 
change a remote’s shortname. For instance, if you want to rename 
the remote pb to paul, you can do so with git remote rename: 
git remote rename pb paul. To remove a remote, you do:
git remote rm remotename.
