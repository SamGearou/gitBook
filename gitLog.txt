After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, you'll probably want to look back to see what happened.  You can do this using the git log command.  By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order, that is, the most recent commits show up first. The weird 40 character code is called a SHA-1. git log -p shows the difference introduced in each commit.
