The easiest way to integrate the branches, as we’ve already covered, is the merge command
However, there is another way: rebasing. for example, say you have two branches, deploy and
master, and they diverged and they have one common ancestor and one diverged commit each
say you are on the deploy branch and you run: git rebase master. This will make deploy 
one commit ahead of master. Then you can do a fast-forward on master so it is up to date
with deploy
