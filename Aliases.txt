Aliases shorten up commands for you. You can easily
set up an alias for each command using git config.
Some examples:
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
This means that, instead of typing git commit, you 
just need to type git ci, and instead of typing
git status, you just need to type git st. This 
technique can also be very useful in creating commands 
that you think should exist. For example, to correct the 
usability problem you encountered with unstaging a file, 
you can add your own unstage alias to Git: 
git config --global alias.unstage "reset HEAD --"
now these two commands are equivalent:
git unstage fileA
git reset HEAD fileA.
