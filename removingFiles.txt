To remove a file from Git, you have to remove
it from your tracked files (more accurately,
remove it from your staging area) and then commit. 
The git rm command does that, and also removes
the file from your working directory so you don't
see it as an untrakced file the next time around.
The file gets removed from Github as soon as you make a new commit
Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your 
working tree but remove it from your staging area. You do this with 
the command: git rm --cached filename
